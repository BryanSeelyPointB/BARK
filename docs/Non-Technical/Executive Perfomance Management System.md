# General:
>* Do everything in Lever. Don't email outside the system. Use Notes as email by @mentioning the PB Associate. Unless you have to add attachments. 
>* If you put it in RPM comments now put it in as a note.  Use @mention vs email outside system. Configure your notifications and use inbox to manage communications.  RPM Notes need to be marked secret. You can click edit and update along the candidate journey.
>* Use Notes to document Actions, next steps or decisions.  Use the notes as if you weren't coming to work tomorrow. How can another team member pick up the record and run with it?
>* Utilize Chrome for web browser as Lever is not optimized on Internet Explorer 

## Rules
	1. All Pbers must go into Lever now. No spoon feeding details available on candidate record
	2. @Mention for PB Communication even with each other = no outside email

## Changes:
	1. Associates will need to become comfortable with Lever
	2. Interviewer blocks
	3. RC assistance with scheduling interviews


## Associates
* All associates will have access to Lever. It will be in Okta. It's how they will do referrals, apply to internal roles and complete interviews. They will only see info you push to them that is need to know. They can't get in and see the dashboard view of candidates.  They will receive @mentions via email and reply to them as email. 

Owner, Follower, Access:
* Owner is critical. It shows ownership/responsibility for the candidate relationship within our teams. Please coordinate with the owner when interacting with the candidate. Ex: if you find them as a lead check in with owner if it's not clear the last time the person was contacted.
* The system only allows one owner per candidate and one owner per job posting
* Note if the hiring manager or AL is not one of the roles on the posting or candidate they will not even see the candidate exists.
* Access is like follower/owner but without as many notifications. Follower gives lots of notifications.

Notifications
* Review the notification settings as a group and choose your preferences for go live
* Blue dot - means we have gone dark on the candidate. Shows last interaction.
* Notes 
		○ This replaces RPM comments. 
		○ @mention any Point Ber. For interview level they will receive an email and when they reply it posts in Lever to your conversation string.
		○ Use this as your first way to communicate. Stay out of your personal email box because we can't cover for each other, it clutters your email, fragments your organization of information, puts you in multiple systems causing efficiency loses due to switching screens, makes management of the process manual.
	
Snooze Feature:
* The snooze functionality allows you to hide candidates from your team’s active pipeline and revisit the candidates at a future date.
* If you send an email to someone that is snoozed, it will automatically un-snooze them and make them active again.  You can send emails future dated before you put them on snooze 
* NOTE: The snooze applies to the candidate record and is not a user specific snooze. If you snooze a candidate, it will snooze them from everyone in Lever 


Search: Two ways to search and filter information
	1. Boolean search from top right search box. Searches globally, all information in Lever. Utilize boolean search strings to focus results. And, Or, NOT. Practice one live.
	2. Right side panel - think of this like filters on column in excel. Slices the information. Practice live. Tags are critical to slicing information and resurfacing the right candidate pool in your results.  See tag methodology tab.

Your Workspace:
* Tasks: incomplete tasks assigned to you will stay at the top of your Lever inbox until you've completed them.
* Your inbox - keep this clean like your email. Try to dismiss all read frequently and dismiss all maybe daily or weekly to keep it uncluttered.
* Be careful when leaving windows open. It saves so you will get a lot of drafts. Don't click the X but discard changes on interview scheduling. When adding candidate if you sit with it open it will create a blank candidate name.
* Email templates - 
		○ Copy a general template to your own workspace and save 
		○ Anywhere you see carrots you need to manually enter the value. It is not an auto-populate field like in Taleo (ex: Dear <<INSERT REFERENCE NAME>> needs to be filled in)

User Access:
* Sensitive Information Privileges (SIP) controls when users can see secret notes, secret fields, secret forms (i.e., compensation detail), etc.  
		○ We have given the Firmwide Recruiting team SIP to all candidates (aside from Business Partner or Point B Direct) 
		○ You can add a secret note and give someone access to that note using @mention (i.e., adding secret note for Hiring Manager about the candidate) 
* All Point Brs will have Interviewer access to submit referrals, share social referral links. From this portal they can see the status of their referrals (the stage they are in)
* Point B Interviewers will not have access to the candidate profile.  Point B Interviewers will be only be setup with Interviewer only access and will only see the Interviewer tab to see the following:  
		○ Interviews
		○ Referrals
		○ Social Referrals
* The majority of other Recruiting Team Users (TAD, TAM, RPM) will be Admins or Team Members and will have Sensitive Information Privileges 
		○ Team Members will have ability to see:
			- All candidates
			- All job posting reports
			- Manage offers
			- Edit email templates 
		○ Admins can do all that the Team Members can do, but they will also have the ability to:
			- Run other reports (except offer reports)
			- Create/update feedback forms
			- Create/update form templates 
			- Create/update tags - this will be LOCKED down and controlled so our tags do not get diluted 
			- Add users (Admin and below) 
			- Manage requisitions 
* Hiring Managers will be setup as Limited Team Members. 
		○ They will not be able to see any Sensitive Information (secret notes, secret fields, secret forms (i.e., compensation detail), etc.  They will only be able to see offers where they are the Hiring Manager on that specific offer. Unless we create a specific secret note and @mention them where they will be able to see the secret note
		○ Just because they are a hiring manager on the job posting does not mean they can see the offer.  They must be the Hiring Manager on the Offer (i.e., Offer Approver)
