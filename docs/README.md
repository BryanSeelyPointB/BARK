> IT institutional memory goes here

## What is it?
The **B**iz **A**pps **R**epository for **K**nowledge is a document repository that generates on the fly. Just add or edit your doc and it will update instantly. No need for HTML or clucnk on page editing.

## Why?
As our team tools evolve, we collaborate in context more often. For example, we use Teams for chats and group discussions, emails for cross-team communication, Jira comments and tasks for work tracking, Lucidchart for diagramming, mural for brainstorming etc. However, when it comes time to track institutional knowledge, there was no obvious place to consolidate our outcomes and wrap everything up with a bow.
